# Welcome

## Heyo!
Welcome to my blog! Here, I talk about **Coding**, **Coding**, and some **Interesting** projects.

I'll mostly share about things that happened during the day, or coding tutorials. Make sure to check out my projects! :)

## Why?
I always had a dream of opening my own blog, lol. Don't really know why. But I guess I will find out more about the joy of blogging soon! Thank you for reading this. You made my day.

## Want to give comments?
Navigate to the bottom of each post. Click `Sign In with Github`, then post your comment! They will be publicly visible to like *everyone*, so post wisely.
